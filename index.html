    <p>In college I hope to study in classes that have to do with psychology and crime. I would like to major in Forensic Psychology. I've found myself interested in wanting to figure out how the human mind works when it comes to the crime committed and how the mind got to that point. In the future, I would like to accomplish a job in that field and make an impact.</p>
